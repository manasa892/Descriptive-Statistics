1.Numpy Average
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read author data
greatest_books = pd.read_csv("top-hundred-books.csv")

# Set author ages to a NumPy array
author_ages = greatest_books['Ages']

# Use numpy to calculate the average age of the top 100 authors
average_age = np.average(author_ages)

print("The average age of the 100 greatest authors, according to a survey by Le Monde, is: " + str(average_age))

2.Median 
import numpy as np

# Array of the first five author ages

# Fill in the empty array with the values sorted
sorted_author_ages = np.array([29, 32, 42, 43, 49])

# Save the median value to median_value
median_age = 42

# Print the sorted array and median value
print("The sorted array is: " + str(sorted_author_ages))

3.Mode 
import numpy as np

# Set first_ten_authors equal to their ages
first_ten_authors = np.array([29, 49, 42, 43, 32, 38, 37, 41, 27, 27])

# Save the mode value to mode_age

# Save the count of authors with the mode age

4.mode Scipy
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Read in author data
greatest_books = pd.read_csv("top-hundred-books.csv")

# Save author ages to author_ages
author_ages = greatest_books['Ages']

# Use numpy to calculate the mode age of the top 100 authors
mode_age = stats.mode(author_ages)

print("The mode age and its frequency of authors from Le Monde's 100 greatest books is: " + str(mode_age[0][0]) + " and " + str(mode_age[1][0]))
